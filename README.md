# ðŸŒŸ Hi, I am Ghadah Alotiabi ðŸŒŸ

## About Me ðŸš€


*It's my pleasure to introduce myself as Ghadah, a backend developer with a keen interest in Data Science and AI. I've been attending courses and webinars to learn more about this topic. My passion for learning new things and improving myself never ceases. It is constantly a challenge for me to learn new algorithms and techniques so that I can implement them in my projects. From time to time, I also enjoy doing side projects to put what I have learned into practice.*
